## Description
- Welcome to the Nclose developer assessment repository.
- Please select the relevant role assessment you are applying for from the above `table of content`.
- Although this assessment will not be timed we believe it shouldn't take you too long to complete.
- You are free to use the internet for research but **DON'T** copy/paste code. We will know!
- Intial steps to follow:
    + Clone this repo.
    + Create your own branch using your name as the branch name: `fistname_surname`
    + Install and configure all required components listed in `Requirements` section.
    + Follow the instructions outlined in the `Challenge` section.
    + Create a `README.md` file in your branch which lists your start date/time and end date/time.
       + For extra points you can add a brief description of your approach.
    + **Commit only to your branch.**
- We encourage you to relax and enjoy the process as this is what we enjoy.
- What we need is clean, readable, maintainable code that will result in a responsive, efficient end product.
- The goal is not to trip you up but to gauge your role in the team.
- Good luck and have fun!
