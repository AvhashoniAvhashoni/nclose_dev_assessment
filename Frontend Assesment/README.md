# Nclose - Task app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Congrats on receiving this coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript and Angular.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this task app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- See useable UI elements built with Angular Material.
- See components keep their ratio when scaling down to smaller screens using media queries.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Add new tasks to the list.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Clear all tasks.
- Log the users public ip in the console.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

The designs are in PDF format.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder.

Angular Material `https://material.angular.io/`.

Public IP API:
Perform a `get` on `https://api.ipify.org/?format=json` which should return a string.

## Building your project

Below is a defined process we expect you to follow:

1. Clone our project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nclose-ZA/dev_assessment).
2. Read through the cloned project README.
3. Create your own branch using your name as the branch name: fistname_surname.
4. Look through the designs to start planning your component views and different states.
5. Use Angular 13 specifically to build this project.
6. When the app renders we expect to see our public ip logged in the console, use a service with a `getIP()` function to achieve this.

## Submitting your project

- Commit only to your branch.
- Create a README.md file in your branch which lists your start date/time and end date/time.
- For extra points you can add a brief description of your approach.


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
